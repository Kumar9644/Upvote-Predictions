# Upvote-Predictions
I have uploaded the nortebook file of my ML project where is have used Linear regression to predict the number of upvotes in a data set. I used featuring engineering to get the desired result.
I used label encoder,Standard scaler for the preprocessing. I tried using Random Forest Regressor but it didn't give the satisfcatory result. I then tried polynomial regression and it worked fine. There were some outliers in the dataset so i used 95 %entile to remove the outliers from our data set.
